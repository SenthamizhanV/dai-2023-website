                                           I am currently a third-year PhD student at Université de Montréal (MILA) advised
                                            by Prof. Aaron Courville. My interests lie in applications of machine 
                                            learning/deep learning in natural language processing. I am currently working 
                                            towards approaches where NLP models have better generalization capabilities and 
                                            hence are more robust in practical environments. Previously, I had been working 
                                            in the natural language generation (NLG) project in IBM Research India for three
                                             years and have published papers in top conferences and journals like NeurIPS,
                                              ACL, NAACL, INTERSPEECH, and Computational Linguistics. Our work on NLG was 
                                              successfully deployed to provide match insights and commentary in US Open 2020
                                               Tennis Tournament. At IBM, I also contributed towards the IBM Project Debater,
                                               which received wide news coverage worldwide because of a LIVE machine vs human
                                                debate. Prior to joining IBM, I held positions like Applied Scientist at 
                                                Microsoft Bing Ads (2013-2015) and SDE at Amazon.com (2010-2011).</p>-->

                                            The last decade has seen rapid strides in Artificial Intelligence (AI) moving from being a fantasy to a reality that is a part of each one of our lives, embedded in various technologies. A catalyst of this rapid uptake has been the enormous success of deep learning methods for addressing problems in various domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech understanding. However, as AI makes its way into risk-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as healthcare, aerospace and finance, it is essential for AI models to not only make predictions but also be able to explain their predictions. This talk will introduce the audience to this increasingly important area of explainable AI (XAI), as well as present an overview of existing methods in XAI -- focusing on methods used in tandem with deep neural network models.</p>-->

                                            Amit has always been interested in understanding things, even before working on explainable AI his research focused on 
                                            understanding different AI methods in terms of their statistical behavior. He has worked on projects spanning multiple 
                                            industries such as Semi-conductor manufacturing, Oil and Gas, Procurement, Retail, Utilities, Airline, Health Care. 
                                            His current research includes proposing various methods for enhancing trust in systems by developing methods that try
                                            to explain or understand their behaviors. His recent work was featured in Forbes and PC magazine with corresponding

                                            application award as well as being selected as Best of ICDM twice. For his work on explainability he was invited to attend 
                                            a Schloss Dagstuhl seminar in 2019 and 2021. He also Co-led the creation of the AI Explainability 360 open source toolkit. 
                                            Besides research impact, his work has also gone into IBM product and he has received Outstanding Technical Achievement as
                                            well as IBM Corporate award. He has been an Area Chair and PC member for top AI conferences as well as has served on National

                                            Narayanan Unny has been a Machine Learning researcher for more than a decade starting with a PhD in Bayesian learning
                                            from University of Edinburgh. He started his work in industrial research in Xerox Research Centre where he had
                                            contributed to the use of Machine Learning in intelligent transportation systems including some of the transportation
                                            systems in India. The research included use of machine learning to aid robust and dynamic scheduling of public transport.
                                            He currently leads the research team on Machine Learning in AI Labs within American Express and is currently actively
                                            researching different aspects of Ethical AI and Differential Privacy.</p>
